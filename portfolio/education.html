                    I Then transfered up to Brigham Young University Idaho to get my Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Technology with an emphasis in cybersecurity. While studying here I have also learned write bash scripts and program using python. I have also learned how to use various operating systems and setup and design a network. I have had classes that have taught me how to interact with windows and linux terminals to be able to accomplish the needed tasks done through that medium.
